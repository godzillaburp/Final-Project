# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Meme Deep Fryer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that deep fries memes

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will allow the user to input an image. Once the image is submitted, the program will alter the RGB values of the image. The values will be changed in accordance to how a meme is typically "deep fried". Once complete the program will print a deep fried version of the user inputted image.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Rebecca Pierre: tuj48152@temple.edu, Chong Li
Nick Kruse: tug97216@temple.edu, Tamara Katic

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The program will deep fry the user inputted image.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The program will deep fry the user inputted image and add user inputted text in impact font.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The program will deep fry the user inputted image, add user inputted text in impact font, and add random emojis.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to learn how to have python accept and work with an image. Then, we need to figure out how to change the RGB values of the image to make it look deep fried. Then we need to figure out how to have the program print the image for the user to take. If all this is accomplished, we will move on to adding input based impact font text and random emoji generation.
